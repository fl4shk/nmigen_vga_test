PDM:  Make an accumulator of samples that's the same width as your samples.
Use the carry out of the adder as the PDM output.

Filter:  low pass of some sort


<emeb> then on the output pick R & C so the corner is at or below nyquist of the sample rate.
<emeb> for my system the sample rate is << clock rate

<FL4SHK> emeb, regarding picking R and C "so the corner is at or below nyquist of the sample rate", what's the "corner"?


<emeb> the corner frequency of an RC low-pass filter is F = 1/(2piR*C)

<emeb> so pick your R and C values so that F is at about 1/2 the sample
rate.

<emeb> ie - I wanted about a 20kHz corner frequency so I used a 100 ohm R
and a 0.1uF C

<FL4SHK> Is F the highest frequency that'll get passed through?

<agg> bear in mind if you are just using a single RC filter, it rolls off
very slowly, so you might actually want to put the -3dB frequency a lot
lower than half your sample rate

<emeb> Well, a single-pole RC lowpass doesn't roll off fast. That's where
it starts to ramp down at 6dB/oct

<FL4SHK> I don't know what "rolling off" means


<Yehowshua> Well is signal processing, you can delete frequencies - they
are attenuated smoothly
<Yehowshua> **can't
<Yehowshua> **in not is

<emeb> If you plot a curve of attenuation vs frequency - roll off is how it
slopes downward with increasing freq

<emeb> not really. this is pretty fool-proof
