* Right now the idea is to convert src assembly to expanded, then to encoded
* I think this isn't the best idea?
* I think it makes more sense to go to partially encoded, necessitating
some kind of representation for immediates.
* Immediates that get too large will end up causing the instruction to get
a `pre` before it.
* The size of an instruction is either 32-bit or 64-bit.  Once an
instruction becomes 64-bit, it *stays* 64-bit.  This is done even if the
immediate could potentially be shrunk later.
